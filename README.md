## Features
- **Multiple image viewing**: As the user can add up to 4 images at once, and view their (magnitude, phase, real, and imaginary plots).

- **Contrast & Brightness control**: The user can control the contrast & brightness of each image, and see the effect immediately.

- **Two major modes of mixing**: The user can mix images using two modes (magnitude & phase mode, and real & imaginary mode).

- **Percentage mixing**: The user can mix the images' parts he got from FT to get a new images, he can control percentage of each participating part with sliders.

- **Two major modes of region mixing**: User can select the region he wants to cut, he can also use the (Inner mode) for mixing only the area surrounded by the recatangle, or (Outer mode) for mixing the surroundings and ignoring the inner data.
